This document outlines the planning of an information system as outlined in the specifications for the 
Systems Analysis and Design course at UofL. This document was produced in order to introduced the fundamentals 
of object-oriented analysis and design. Topics included were requirements determination, feasibility analysis, 
modeling with Unified Modeling Language, data dictionary construction, data modeling and normalization, user 
interface requirements specification, prototyping, and information security procedures. Our team went through 
six iterations using an agile development process to develop this plan.
